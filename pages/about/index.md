aboutMeIntroductionText: Hey! I'm Manuel. A Web- & Mobile-Developer doing most of the stuff with React/React-Native and related packages and technologies. As a self-taught coder - coming from a professional area of technical product development and project management starting in 2010 - I am happy to follow my passion for coding to 100% as a freelance developer nowadays. I like to go to meetups, talk to other developers about promising technologies and give my wife and daughter a big hug when I come home from my office.

## About me
Wow! I love blogging so much already.

Did you know that "despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the egg yolk will be less rich."? ([Wikipedia Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg))

Yeah, I didn't either.
